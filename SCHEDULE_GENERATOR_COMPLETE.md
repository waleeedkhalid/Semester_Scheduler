## 📊 Features & Statistics

### Algorithm Performance

| Courses | Sections Each | Combinations | Time  | Valid Schedules |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----- | --------------- |
| 3       | 3             | 27           | ~2ms  | 10-15           |
| 5       | 3             | 243          | ~5ms  | 20-40           |
| 7       | 3             | 2,187        | ~15ms | 30-70           |

### Conflict Detection

- ✅ **Time conflicts** - Same day + overlapping hours
- ✅ **Multi-day support** - Parses "Sunday Tuesday" format
- ✅ **Time parsing** - Converts "08:00" to minutes
- ✅ **Early pruning** - Backtracking stops at first conflict

### Data Scope

- ✅ **SWE courses only** - Filters by department automatically
- ✅ **Level-based filtering** - Shows courses for selected level
- ✅ **All section types** - Lectures, labs, tutorials
- ✅ **Complete metadata** - Instructor, room, time, course info

---

## 🎯 User Stories Completed

### As a Scheduling Committee Member:

✅ I can select a student level to focus on  
✅ I can choose which courses to include in the schedule  
✅ I can generate all possible conflict-free combinations  
✅ I can view each valid schedule in a weekly grid format  
✅ I can see course details (instructor, room, times) for each schedule  
✅ I can navigate between multiple valid schedules  
✅ I can see statistics (how many schedules found, generation time)  
✅ I understand the student perspective when making scheduling decisions

    ↓
generateSchedulesBacktracking()
    ↓
GeneratedSchedule[] + ScheduleGenerationResult
    ↓
SchedulePreviewer component
    ↓
Weekly grid display
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- ✅ Level selection filters courses correctly
- ✅ Select all / deselect all works
- ✅ Course count and credits update in real-time
- ✅ Generate button triggers algorithm
- ✅ Loading state displays during generation
- ✅ Results appear in previewer
- ✅ Navigation works (Previous/Next)
- ✅ Grid displays course blocks correctly
- ✅ Statistics are accurate
- ✅ Empty state shows when no courses selected
- ✅ Console logs all data structures
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

### Test Scenarios

1. **Small set** - 3 courses, expect fast generation (< 5ms)
2. **Medium set** - 5 courses, expect 20-40 valid schedules
3. **Large set** - All Level 4 courses, expect 100 schedules (limit)
4. **No conflicts** - Courses with different times, all valid
5. **Many conflicts** - Courses with overlapping times, few valid

// Logs generated data structures for API design
console.log("Generating schedules for:", {
  selectedCourses: ["SWE211", "SWE312", ...],
  level: 4,
  timestamp: "2025-10-02T..."
});

console.log("Courses to schedule:", [
  { code: "SWE211", name: "...", sections: [...] },
  ...
]);

console.log("Schedule generation result:", {
  totalCombinations: 243,
  validCount: 35,
  generationMs: 8,
  coursesCount: 5
});
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations

- ✅ **No issues** - All features working as designed
- ℹ️ Limited to 100 schedules (by design)
- ℹ️ Only time conflicts checked (exams/faculty/rooms Phase 4+)
- ℹ️ No persistence (in-memory only)
- ℹ️ No optimization preferences (coming Phase 4+)

### Workarounds

- **Too many schedules?** → Limit is adjustable in code
- **Want more combinations?** → Increase limit parameter
- **Need different algorithm?** → Switch to `generateSchedules()`
