# Student Counts Management - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

The **Student Counts Table** has been upgraded from a read-only display to a fully functional CRUD management interface, following the same pattern as Exam Management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Local State Management (`src/lib/local-state.ts`)

Added student counts state management with:

```typescript
export type StudentCount = {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  total_students: number;
};
```

**CRUD Functions:**

- `getAllStudentCounts()` - Get all student count records
- `getStudentCountByCode(code)` - Get specific course's student count
- `updateStudentCount(code, updates)` - Update student count data
- `addStudentCount(studentCount)` - Create new student count record
- `deleteStudentCount(code)` - Delete student count record

All functions include:

- ✅ Console logging with success indicators
- ✅ Validation (duplicate checks for create)
- ✅ Deep cloning to avoid mutation issues
- ✅ Integration with `resetToMockData()` for testing

### 2. StudentCountsTable Component Enhancements

**File:** `src/components/committee/scheduler/student-counts/StudentCountsTable.tsx`

**New Features:**

- ✨ **Create Button** - "Add Student Count" button in card header
- ✨ **Edit Button** - Pencil icon for each row to edit student count
- ✨ **Delete Button** - Trash icon with confirmation dialog
- ✨ **Dialog Form** - Modal form with validation for all fields
- ✨ **Intelligent Section Planner** - Automatically calculates recommended sections and size distribution

**Form Fields:**

- Course Code (required, uppercase auto-format, disabled when editing)
- Course Name (required)
- Level (required, number 1-10)
- Total Students (required, number ≥ 0)

**Validation:**

- Create button disabled until all required fields are valid
- Prevents duplicate course codes
- Number validation for level and student count
- Clear error messages on validation failure

**UI Features:**

- Actions column with edit/delete buttons
- Maintains totals row with updated counts
- Smooth dialog open/close with state reset
- Debug console logging for draft state

### 3. Page Integration

**File:** `src/app/demo/committee/scheduler/page.tsx`

Added handler functions:

```typescript
handleStudentCountCreate(data: StudentCount)
handleStudentCountUpdate(code: string, data: Partial<StudentCount>)
handleStudentCountDelete(code: string)
```

**State Management:**

- Uses `useState` with `getAllStudentCounts()`
- `refreshData()` updates both courses and student counts
- Real-time UI updates after any CRUD operation
- Console logging for all operations with ✅/❌ indicators

## Section Planning Algorithm

The component includes an **intelligent section planner** that:

**Constraints:**

- Ideal section size: 25 students
- Maximum section size: 27 students (overflow tolerance)
- Minimum section size: 18 students (avoid small sections)

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate min/max possible sections based on capacity constraints
2. Find best section count closest to ideal average of 25
3. Distribute students evenly (base + base+1 pattern)
4. Recompute if any section falls below minimum size
5. Display plan as "2×26, 1×23" format

**Example:**

- 75 students → 3 sections (2×25, 1×25)
- 80 students → 3 sections (2×27, 1×26)
- 50 students → 2 sections (2×25)

## Console Output Examples

### Creating a Student Count

```javascript
Current student count draft: { code: 'SWE555', name: 'Advanced Topics', level: 8, total_students: 40 }
✅ Added student count: { code: 'SWE555', name: 'Advanced Topics', level: 8, total_students: 40 }
✅ Student count created successfully
```

### Updating a Student Count

```javascript
✅ Updated student count: { code: 'SWE211', name: 'Intro to SWE', level: 4, total_students: 80 }
✅ Student count updated successfully
```

### Deleting a Student Count

```javascript
❌ Deleting student count: SWE555
✅ Deleted student count: { code: 'SWE555', name: 'Advanced Topics', level: 8, total_students: 40 }
✅ Student count deleted successfully
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Create Operation

1. Navigate to `/demo/committee/scheduler`
2. Click "Add Student Count" button
3. Fill in all fields:
   - Course Code: `SWE999`
   - Course Name: `Test Course`
   - Level: `5`
   - Total Students: `55`
4. Click "Create"
5. Verify new row appears in table
6. Check browser console for success logs

### Test Edit Operation

1. Click pencil icon on any existing row
2. Modify any field (e.g., change total students from 75 to 80)
3. Click "Update"
4. Verify changes appear in table
5. Note: Course code cannot be edited (primary key)

### Test Delete Operation

1. Click trash icon on any row
2. Confirm deletion in alert dialog
3. Verify row disappears from table
4. Check console for deletion logs

### Test Validation

1. Click "Add Student Count"
2. Leave fields empty - Create button should be disabled
3. Fill Course Code only - button still disabled
4. Complete all required fields - button enables
5. Try entering negative number for students - validation prevents
6. Try entering level < 1 or > 10 - validation prevents

## Architecture Patterns Used

### 1. Consistent CRUD Pattern

Following the same pattern as `ExamTable`:

- Dialog for create/edit forms
- Separate handlers for each operation
- State management with local-state module
- Console logging for debugging

### 2. Form State Management

```typescript
const [draft, setDraft] = useState<StudentCount>(DEFAULT_DRAFT);
const [editingCode, setEditingCode] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
```

### 3. Handler Pattern

```typescript
const handleSubmit = () => {
  // Validation
  if (!draft.code || !draft.name || ...) return;

  // Create or Update based on editingCode
  if (editingCode) {
    onUpdate(editingCode, draft);
  } else {
    onCreate(draft);
  }

  // Cleanup
  reset();
  setOpen(false);
};
```

### 4. Data Refresh Pattern

```typescript
const refreshData = () => {
  setCourses(getAllCourses());
  setStudentCounts(getAllStudentCounts());
};
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/local-state.ts` - Added StudentCount type and CRUD functions
2. ✅ `src/components/committee/scheduler/student-counts/StudentCountsTable.tsx` - Added CRUD UI
3. ✅ `src/app/demo/committee/scheduler/page.tsx` - Integrated handlers and state
4. ✅ `docs/plan.md` - Updated change log

## UI Design Philosophy

Following the user requirement for **"simple and look nice"**:

- ✨ Clean card-based layout with clear header
- ✨ Compact dialog forms with grid layouts
- ✨ Icon buttons for actions (space-efficient)
- ✨ Color-coded actions (edit = neutral, delete = red)
- ✨ Smart section planning displayed inline
- ✨ Responsive table with proper text alignment
- ✨ Totals row with muted background

## Future Enhancements

When backend is implemented:

- [ ] Replace `local-state.ts` with API calls to `/api/student-counts`
- [ ] Add server-side validation
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Add bulk import/export functionality
- [ ] Add audit logging for changes
- [ ] Link to course offerings for consistency checks
