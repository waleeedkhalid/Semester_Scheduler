# Tasks

## 1. Preparation Work

### Analysis
1. Conduct stakeholder workflow workshop to document end-to-end scheduling, feedback, and approval steps for each persona.
2. Collect representative Edugate Excel exports and define required fields, data mappings, and quality tolerances.
3. Inventory all scheduling rules and constraint priorities, including breaks, midterm slots, lab blocks, elective timing, and cross-level policies.
4. Map notification events, recipients, and escalation rules for updates, timeline reminders, and missing irregular student data.
5. Document data access and privacy expectations per persona for schedule, feedback, and dashboard information.

### Design
1. Select target system architecture (frontend, backend, collaboration service) that supports real-time editing and auto-save.
2. Design domain data model for students, courses, sections, schedules, rules, feedback, surveys, and version history.
3. Design schedule lifecycle state machine covering initial draft, committee review, student feedback, revisions, and finalization.
4. Design integration blueprint for student elective survey flow, including question set, authentication, and storage.
5. Design collaboration framework (e.g., websocket events, locking strategy, comment threading) for scheduling and teaching load committees.
6. Produce UX wireframes for scheduler, registrar, teaching load committee, faculty, and student interfaces across key tasks.
7. Define notification delivery channels, content templates, and timing automation logic.

## 2. Planned Tasks

### Analysis
1. Capture detailed acceptance criteria for each persona's critical workflows and review with stakeholders.
2. Document success metrics and non-functional targets (latency, concurrency, uptime) for scheduling engine and collaboration features.
3. Create end-to-end event catalog enumerating triggers, payloads, and recipients for the notification system.

### Design
1. Define API contracts for schedule management, feedback submission, survey handling, and notifications.
2. Produce database schema migration plan for core entities (students, sections, schedules, feedback, rules, versions).
3. Design validation rules and parsing logic for Edugate Excel ingestion, including error reporting format.
4. Design business rule configuration UI flows and backend rule evaluation strategy.
5. Design version history storage approach including change diffs and retrieval queries.
6. Design dashboard data aggregation queries for level and course overviews.
7. Design notification queueing and delivery architecture including timeline-driven jobs.

### Implementation
1. Implement Edugate Excel import service with schema validation, error handling, and audit logging.
2. Implement configuration module to manage default section size with override support per course or section.
3. Implement irregular student data entry workflow and notification trigger to request missing data from registrar.
4. Implement module for recording fixed course slots and integrating them into scheduling constraints.
5. Implement scheduling rule management interface and backend CRUD for rules and priorities.
6. Implement constraint evaluation engine enforcing institutional rules (daily break, midterm slots, contiguous sessions, elective timing, prerequisite pairing, cross-level electives).
7. Implement automatic schedule generation service producing initial drafts using student counts, fixed slots, and constraints.
8. Implement schedule versioning storage with diff tracking and rollback support.
9. Implement teaching load committee workspace with review, comment, and feedback submission capabilities.
10. Implement student portal features for elective survey submission, schedule viewing, and feedback entry for the second draft.
11. Implement faculty portal for availability capture, schedule review, and feedback submission.
12. Implement feedback handling pipeline to consolidate comments from all personas and surface actionable items to schedulers.
13. Implement real-time collaborative editing and commenting solution for scheduling and teaching load committees.
14. Implement notification service handling event-driven alerts and scheduled timeline reminders.
15. Implement dashboard views for level and course overviews with live metrics and drill-down.
16. Implement auto-save mechanism for schedule edits with conflict detection.
17. Implement finalization workflow to apply feedback updates, lock schedule, and prepare submission artifacts.

### Testing
1. Develop test plan covering data import validation, scheduling engine scenarios, feedback workflows, and notifications.
2. Implement automated unit and integration tests for scheduling engine, rule enforcement, and versioning.
3. Execute usability tests with representative stakeholders for each persona interface.
4. Run load and concurrency tests on real-time collaboration and notification systems.
5. Conduct end-to-end user acceptance testing on initial and second schedule generation workflows with stakeholder sign-off.

### Deployment
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment gates for staging and production.
2. Provision staging and production environments with required services (database, collaboration infrastructure, job schedulers).
3. Implement configuration management for scheduling rules, notification templates, and survey content per environment.
4. Establish monitoring, logging, and alerting for scheduling runs, collaboration sessions, and notification delivery.
5. Prepare release checklist and rollback procedures for schedule generation cycles.

## 3. Suggestions for Missing Work

### Analysis
1. Conduct data privacy compliance assessment covering storage of student preferences and feedback.
2. Identify identity and access management integration requirements with university SSO systems.

### Design
1. Plan accessibility compliance targets for all interfaces (e.g., WCAG level) and validation approach.
2. Design audit logging strategy for schedule edits, approvals, and rule changes.

### Implementation
1. Establish backup and recovery processes for schedule versions, survey responses, and rule configurations.
2. Evaluate integration with institutional email or SMS gateways if notifications must exit the platform.

### Testing
1. Define disaster recovery and failover testing scenarios for schedule data and collaboration services.

### Deployment
1. Coordinate go-live communication and training plan with deanship, registrar, faculty, and student stakeholders.
