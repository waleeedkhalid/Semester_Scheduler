# Theme Colors Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Task:** COLOR-10 - Apply themed colors to entire project

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Updated Default Theme Colors in `globals.css`

**Changed the `:root` and `.dark` CSS variables to use Academic Twilight theme:**

- **Light Mode (`:root`)**: Now uses the Academic Twilight palette

  - Background: `oklch(0.96 0.01 65)` - Warm parchment
  - Primary: `oklch(0.27 0.08 265)` - Scholar blue
  - Accent: `oklch(0.71 0.08 60)` - Amber glow
  - And all other colors from the Academic Twilight palette

- **Dark Mode (`.dark`)**: Uses Academic Twilight dark variant
  - Background: `oklch(0.12 0.02 270)` - Deep midnight
  - Primary: `oklch(0.71 0.08 60)` - Warm amber
  - Accent: `oklch(0.5 0.1 290)` - Twilight violet

### 2. Applied Theme Class to Root HTML Element

**Updated `src/app/layout.tsx`:**

```tsx
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning className="theme-academic-twilight">
```

This ensures the Academic Twilight theme CSS variables are applied throughout the entire app.

### 3. Created ThemeSwitcher Component

**New file: `src/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`**

Features:

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Button with sun/moon icon
- **Theme Palette Selector**: Dropdown menu to switch between:
  - Academic Twilight (contemplative scholarly work)
  - Desert Dawn (energetic campus life)
  - Emerald Library (timeless academic tradition)
- Dynamically applies theme classes using the `applyTheme()` utility
- Persists user's theme choice

### 4. Added ThemeSwitcher to Homepage

**Updated `src/app/page.tsx`:**

- Added ThemeSwitcher component in top-right corner (fixed position)
- Users can now easily switch themes and toggle dark mode from the homepage

## üé® Available Themes

All three themes from `components.json` are now fully integrated:

### 1. **Academic Twilight** (Default)

- **Story**: The quiet hours when scholars work into the evening
- **Colors**: Deep blues, warm amber, twilight violet
- **Mood**: Contemplative, focused, intellectual depth

### 2. **Desert Dawn**

- **Story**: The campus awakening at sunrise
- **Colors**: Terracotta, sandstone, sunrise gold
- **Mood**: Energetic, warm, optimistic

### 3. **Emerald Library**

- **Story**: Ancient university libraries with green reading lamps
- **Colors**: Deep emerald, rich browns, brass fixtures
- **Mood**: Prestigious, calm, trustworthy

## üîß How It Works

### Theme Application Flow:

1. **Default Theme**: Academic Twilight is applied via:

   - `:root` CSS variables in `globals.css`
   - `.theme-academic-twilight` class on `<html>` element

2. **Theme Switching**: When user selects a different theme:

   - ThemeSwitcher calls `applyTheme(paletteName)`
   - Old theme class is removed from document
   - New theme class is added to document
   - All CSS variables update automatically

3. **Dark Mode**: Works with all three themes:
   - Each theme has light and dark variants defined in `globals.css`
   - Uses `next-themes` for dark mode toggle
   - Theme-specific dark colors activate when `.dark` class is present

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **`src/app/globals.css`** - Updated `:root` and `.dark` with Academic Twilight colors
2. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** - Added `theme-academic-twilight` class to HTML element
3. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Added ThemeSwitcher component to homepage
4. **`src/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`** - New component (created)
5. **`docs/plan.md`** - Updated task board and change log

## üéØ Result

The entire SmartSchedule application now uses the Academic Twilight color theme by default, with the ability for users to:

- ‚úÖ Switch between 3 story-driven color themes
- ‚úÖ Toggle between light and dark modes
- ‚úÖ See consistent theming across all pages and components
- ‚úÖ Experience a cohesive, academic-focused visual design

All shadcn/ui components (buttons, cards, dialogs, etc.) automatically use these theme colors through the CSS variable system.

## üöÄ Testing the Themes

1. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit the homepage: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click the palette icon (üé®) in the top-right corner
4. Select different themes from the dropdown
5. Toggle dark mode with the sun/moon icon
6. Navigate through different pages to see consistent theming
