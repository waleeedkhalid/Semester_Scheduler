**Total:** 12 courses, 25 sections, 24 exams (2 per course)

## Exam Schedule Pattern

All SWE exams follow this pattern:

- **Midterm:** March 12-23, 2026 @ 16:00 (90 minutes)
- **Final:** May 22 - June 2, 2026 @ 09:00 (120 minutes)
- Each course has a unique date to avoid conflicts

### Sample Exam Data Structure

```typescript
exams: {
  midterm: { date: "2026-03-12", time: "16:00", duration: 90 },
  final: { date: "2026-05-22", time: "09:00", duration: 120 },
}
```

## Section Details

Each course has 1-3 sections with:

- **Unique Section ID** (e.g., `SWE211-01`, `SWE211-02`)
- **Instructor Assignment** (15 different SWE faculty members)
- **Room Assignment** (CCIS 2B201-2B224, LAB-101, LAB-102)
- **Meeting Times** (3 meetings/week for 3-credit, 2 meetings/week for 2-credit)

### Sample Instructors

- Prof. Abdullah Al-Shehri
- Dr. Fahad Al-Mutairi
- Dr. Sara Al-Ghamdi
- Dr. Mohammed Al-Qahtani
- Prof. Khalid Al-Turki
- Dr. Faisal Al-Harbi
- Dr. Ahmed Al-Mutlaq
- Dr. Nasser Al-Juhani
- Dr. Tariq Al-Amri
- Prof. Saad Al-Dakhil
- Dr. Yousef Al-Rasheed
- Prof. Majed Al-Harbi
- Dr. Waleed Al-Zahrani
- Prof. Ibrahim Al-Saud
- Dr. Bader Al-Otaibi

## How getExams() Filters Data

The `getExams()` function in `committee-data-helpers.ts` automatically filters to show only SWE department courses:

```typescript
export function getExams(courseOfferings: CourseOffering[]): ExamRecord[] {
  const exams: ExamRecord[] = [];

  courseOfferings.forEach((course) => {
    // Only include SWE department courses
    if (course.department !== "SWE") return;

    Object.entries(course.exams).forEach(([type, examData]) => {
      if (!examData) return;
      exams.push({
        id: `${course.code}-${type}`,
        courseCode: course.code,
        courseName: course.name,
        type: type as "midterm" | "midterm2" | "final",
        date: examData.date,
        time: examData.time,
        duration: examData.duration,
        sectionIds: course.sections.map((s) => s.id),
      });
    });
  });

  return exams;
}
```

## Updated Exam Management Page

**File:** `src/app/demo/committee/scheduler/exams/page.tsx`

Now uses functional local-state management:

```typescript
const [courses, setCourses] = useState(getAllCourses());

const refreshData = () => {
  setCourses(getAllCourses());
};

// Transform courses to exams (SWE only)
const exams = getExams(courses);
const sectionsLookup = getSectionsLookup(courses);
```

**CRUD Operations:**

- ✅ **Create Exam:** `handleCreateExam()` - Calls `createExam()` with real-time refresh
- ✅ **Update Exam:** `handleUpdateExam()` - Calls `updateExam()` with immediate UI update
- ✅ **Delete Exam:** `handleDeleteExam()` - Calls `deleteExam()` with confirmation
- ✅ **Console Logging:** All operations logged with ✅/❌ indicators

## Testing the Implementation

- ✅ Matching entries in `mockSWEPlan`
- ✅ Complete course offerings with exams in `mockCourseOfferings`
- ✅ Department field set to "SWE"
- ✅ Multiple sections with unique IDs
- ✅ Instructor assignments
- ✅ Room assignments
- ✅ Meeting times

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/data/mockData.ts` - Added 12 SWE courses (~700 lines)

3. ✅ `docs/plan.md` - Updated change log

## Architecture Benefits

### Before

- ❌ No SWE courses in mockCourseOfferings
- ❌ ExamTable would be empty (getExams filters by department: "SWE")
- ❌ Only console.log operations (no real state changes)

### After

- ✅ 12 SWE courses with complete data
- ✅ 24 exams visible in ExamTable
- ✅ Full CRUD with immediate UI refresh
- ✅ Consistent data across all collections
- ✅ Real-time state management with local-state.ts

## Console Output Examples

  sectionIds: []
}
```

### Creating an Exam

```

### Deleting an Exam

## Scope Compliance

This implementation aligns with the **SWE Department Only** scope:

✅ All courses have `department: "SWE"`  
✅ Only SWE courses visible in ExamTable (filtered by getExams())  
✅ Prerequisites reference both SWE and external courses  
✅ Section IDs follow SWE naming convention  
✅ Instructor names are Saudi/KSU-appropriate  
✅ Room assignments use CCIS building codes

## Next Steps

When backend is implemented:

- [ ] Replace `local-state.ts` with API calls to `/api/exams`
- [ ] Add server-side validation for date/time conflicts
- [ ] Implement room availability checking
- [ ] Add instructor availability validation
- [ ] Link to sections for capacity checks
- [ ] Add bulk exam scheduling wizard
