# ✅ FUNCTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION - Exam Management & Course Editor

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Focus:** Making Exam Management and Course Editor fully functional  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Local State Management** (`src/lib/local-state.ts`)

A comprehensive state management system that provides persistent in-memory storage until API integration.

#### Features:

- ✅ **Courses State Management**

  - `getAllCourses()` - Get all courses
  - `getCourseByCode(code)` - Find specific course
  - `updateCourse(code, updates)` - Update course properties
  - `addCourse(course)` - Add new course
  - `deleteCourse(code)` - Remove course

- ✅ **Exam State Management**

  - `createExam(courseCode, type, data)` - Create new exam
  - `updateExam(courseCode, type, data)` - Update exam details
  - `deleteExam(courseCode, type)` - Remove exam

- ✅ **Section State Management**

  - `addSection(courseCode, section)` - Add course section
  - `updateSection(courseCode, sectionId, updates)` - Update section
  - `deleteSection(courseCode, sectionId)` - Remove section

- ✅ **Utilities**
  - `resetToMockData()` - Reset to original mock data
  - Deep cloning to avoid mutation
  - Console logging for all operations

---

## 2. **Functional Exam Management**

### Main Scheduler Page (`/demo/committee/scheduler`)

✅ **Full CRUD Operations** for exams:

#### Create Exam:

```typescript
handleExamCreate(examData) {
  - Validates course exists
  - Creates exam with date, time, duration

}
```

#### Update Exam:

```typescript
handleExamUpdate(id, examData) {
  - Finds existing exam
  - Updates properties
  - Refreshes UI
  - Logs changes
}
```

#### Delete Exam:

```typescript
handleExamDelete(id) {
  - Parses exam ID (COURSE-TYPE format)
  - Removes from state
  - Refreshes UI
  - Logs deletion
}
```

### Features:

- ✅ Student Counts (display only)

❌ Schedule Generator removed from main page
✅ Still available at `/demo/committee/scheduler-generator` (if needed)
