## üéØ Core Concept Summary

### **Level-Based Scheduling**

Students are grouped by academic level (4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Each level has:

- **Required SWE courses** - Must be scheduled
- **External courses** - Already scheduled (MATH, PHY, ISL, etc.)
- **Elective slots** - Based on curriculum requirements

### **Generation Process**

```
For each level:
  1. Get external course schedules (FIXED/BLOCKED)
  2. Find available time slots (all slots - blocked)
  3. Assign SWE courses to available slots
  4. Assign faculty to sections
  5. Schedule exams (no conflicts)
  6. Validate (no time/exam conflicts)
```

### **Output**

Conflict-free schedule where students in the same level can:

- ‚úÖ Take all required SWE courses
- ‚úÖ Take all required external courses
- ‚úÖ Take selected elective courses
- ‚úÖ No time conflicts
- ‚úÖ No exam conflicts

## üìä Data Structures

### Key Types Added

```typescript
// Time Management
TimeSlot { day, startTime, endTime }

// Faculty
FacultyAvailability { instructorId, availableSlots, maxTeachingHours, preferences }

// Students
SWEStudent { id, name, level, electivePreferences, isIrregular }

// Curriculum
SWECurriculumLevel { level, requiredSWECourses, externalCourses, electiveSlots }

// Generation
ScheduleGenerationRequest { semester, levels, considerIrregularStudents }
GeneratedSchedule { id, semester, levels, conflicts, metadata }
LevelSchedule { level, studentCount, courses, externalCourses, conflicts }
```

### Mock Data Created

```typescript
// 5 curriculum levels (4-8)
mockSWECurriculum: SWECurriculumLevel[]

// 150 students across 5 levels
mockSWEStudents: SWEStudent[]
// - Level 4: 40 students
// - Level 5: 35 students
// - Level 6: 30 students
// - Level 7: 25 students
// - Level 8: 20 students

// 5 faculty members
mockFacultyAvailability: FacultyAvailability[]
```

## üîç Algorithm Overview

### Input Collection

```
1. Get SWE curriculum for level
2. Get external course schedules (from mockCourseOfferings)
3. Get student count and elective preferences
4. Get faculty availability
```

### Constraint Analysis

```
1. Extract blocked time slots (external courses)
2. Extract blocked exam dates (external exams)
3. Calculate available slots = all slots - blocked slots
4. Filter faculty by course preferences and availability
```

### Schedule Generation

```
1. For each required SWE course:
   a. Calculate sections needed (studentCount / 30)
   b. For each section:
      - Find available time slot
      - Find available faculty
      - Assign and mark slot as used
   c. Schedule exams:
      - Find available exam date
      - Assign midterm and final

2. For electives (if level has slots):
   a. Get elective demand
   b. Open sections for high-demand courses
   c. Follow same assignment process
```

### Validation

```
1. Check no time conflicts within level
2. Check no exam conflicts within level
3. Check faculty load under limit
4. Generate conflict report
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start Steps

### Step 1: Add Types to `src/lib/types.ts`

- `TimeSlot`
- `FacultyAvailability`
- `SWEStudent`
- `SWECurriculumLevel`
- `ScheduleGenerationRequest`
- `GeneratedSchedule`
- `LevelSchedule`
- `ScheduleMetadata`

### Step 2: Create `src/data/mockSWECurriculum.ts`

- Define 5 levels with required/external courses

### Step 3: Create `src/data/mockSWEStudents.ts`

- Generate 150 students with elective preferences

### Step 4: Create `src/data/mockFacultyAvailability.ts`

- Define 5 faculty with availability and preferences

### Step 5: Update `src/data/mockData.ts`

- Export all new mock data
- Add prerequisites to elective packages

### Step 6: Verify

- No TypeScript errors
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Can import new data

**Estimated Time:** 1-1.5 hours

## üí° Key Design Decisions

### Why Level-Based?

- Students in same level take same core courses
- Simplifies scheduling (group scheduling vs individual)
- Matches academic structure
- Easier to maintain and understand

### Why External Courses First?

- They're already scheduled (can't change)
- Treat as constraints (blocked slots)
- SWE courses fill remaining slots
- Avoids impossible conflicts

### Why Greedy Algorithm?

- Simple to implement and understand
- Fast execution (<5 seconds)
- Good enough for small dataset (5 levels, ~20 courses)
- Can upgrade to optimization later if needed

### Why Elective Demand?

- Not all electives are equally popular
- Open sections only for high-demand courses
- Saves faculty resources
- Better utilization

---

## üöß Current Limitations (Phase 3 Scope)

- No individual student constraints
- No room capacity optimization
- No multi-semester planning
- No real-time updates
- Greedy algorithm (not globally optimal)
- No genetic/AI optimization

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Optimization**

   - Genetic algorithms
   - Constraint satisfaction solvers
   - Multi-objective optimization

2. **Individual Schedules**

   - Per-student customization
   - Handle irregular students specially
   - What-if scenario analysis

3. **Resource Optimization**

   - Room capacity and allocation
   - Lab equipment scheduling
   - Faculty workload balancing

4. **Analytics**
   - Demand prediction
   - Pattern analysis
   - Historical trends

## ‚úÖ Ready to Implement

All planning is complete. You can now:

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Use the Quick Start Guide
2. **Follow step-by-step** - Each step has code snippets
3. **Verify incrementally** - Test after each step
4. **Move to Phase 2** - Once Phase 1 is solid

## üìû Questions to Confirm

Before starting implementation, please confirm:

1. ‚úÖ **Approach approved?** Level-based scheduling correct?
2. ‚úÖ **Curriculum accurate?** Level‚Üícourses mapping correct?
3. ‚úÖ **Student counts realistic?** 40, 35, 30, 25, 20 per level?
4. ‚úÖ **Faculty pool sufficient?** 5 instructors enough?
5. ‚úÖ **Ready to start Phase 1?** Build foundation first?
