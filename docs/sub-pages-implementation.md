## Pattern Consistency

All pages follow this structure:

```tsx
<>
  <PersonaNavigation
    personaName="[Persona Name]"
    navItems={[persona]NavItems}
  />

  <PageContainer
    title="[Page Title]"
    description="[Page description]"
  >
    {/* Page content */}
  </PageContainer>
</>
```

## Console Logging Pattern

All form submissions follow Phase 3 mock API pattern:

```typescript
const handleAction = (data: unknown) => {
  console.log("Action description:", data);
  // TODO: Send to API endpoint [METHOD] [PATH]
};
```

## Known Issues & Follow-ups

### Minor Fixes Needed

1. **Versions Page**: VersionTimeline component requires `versions` prop

   - File: `/demo/committee/scheduler/versions/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Pass mock versions data to component

2. **Student ElectiveSurvey**: Component doesn't accept `onSubmit` prop

   - File: `/demo/student/preferences/page.tsx`
   - Check: ElectiveSurvey component interface

3. **Student FeedbackForm**: Component doesn't accept `onSubmit` prop

   - File: `/demo/student/feedback/page.tsx`
   - Check: FeedbackForm component interface

4. **Teaching Load Conflicts**: ConflictList doesn't accept `onResolve` prop

   - File: `/demo/committee/teaching-load/conflicts/page.tsx`
   - Check: ConflictList component interface

5. **External Slots Page**: Unused imports

   - File: `/demo/committee/scheduler/external/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Remove unused Input, Label, Select imports

6. **Suggestions Page**: Badge variant error
   - File: `/demo/committee/teaching-load/suggestions/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Change "destructive" to "secondary" or "outline"

### Component Prop Mismatches

Several existing components need to be updated to accept callback props:

- ElectiveSurvey → add `onSubmit` prop
- FeedbackForm → add `onSubmit` prop
- ConflictList → add `onResolve` prop
- StudentCountsTable → verify `onUpdate` prop exists
- RulesTable → remove `onRuleUpdate` prop requirement

## Navigation Structure Complete

All navigation items from `navigation-config.ts` now have corresponding pages:

✅ Committee (5/5): Schedule Grid, Exams, Rules, External, Versions
✅ Teaching Load (3/3): Load Overview, Conflicts, Suggestions
✅ Registrar (2/2): Irregular Students, Student Counts
✅ Student (3/3): My Schedule, Preferences, Feedback
✅ Faculty (3/3): My Assignments, Availability, Comments

## File Count

**Created:** 11 new page.tsx files
**Total Routes:** 16 persona routes (5 main + 11 sub-pages)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)

1. Fix prop interface mismatches for existing components
2. Remove unused imports causing lint warnings
3. Add mock versions data to Versions page

### Short-term (Priority 2)

4. Test all navigation links work correctly
5. Verify active tab highlighting on sub-pages
6. Add loading states for async operations
7. Implement actual API integration (replace console.log)

### Medium-term (Priority 3)

8. Add form validation feedback
9. Implement optimistic UI updates
10. Add toast notifications for user actions
11. Create mobile-responsive navigation drawer
12. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation
