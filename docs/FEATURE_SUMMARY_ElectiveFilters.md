# ElectiveSurvey Enhancement Summary - Category Filters

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Component:** `src/components/student/electives/ElectiveSurvey.tsx`  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## What Was Built

### Interactive Category Filters

Added smart filtering system to help students quickly find and select elective courses by requirement category.

## Key Features

### 1. **Filter Chips/Badges**

- Clickable badges for each elective category
- "All Courses" option to show everything
- Visual active/inactive states
- Smooth hover transitions

### 2. **Smart Counters**

- Format: `Category (available/total)`
- Updates dynamically as courses selected
- Shows at-a-glance availability
- Example: "Islamic Studies (1/3)" = 1 available, 2 already selected

### 3. **Clear Filter Button**

- Appears when category filter active
- Quick reset to "All Courses" view
- Convenient redundant control

### 4. **Dynamic Placeholder**

- Dropdown text updates with filter context
- "Select a course..." vs "Select from Math/Statistics..."
- Clear feedback about filtered state

### 5. **Filter Icon**

- Visual indicator using lucide-react Filter icon
- Helps users identify filter section

## Categories Available

From SWE degree plan (`mockElectivePackages`):

1. **Islamic Studies** - 3 courses (ISL101-103) â€¢ 2-4 hours required
2. **Math/Statistics** - 3 courses (MATH202, STAT201, MATH301) â€¢ 0-6 hours optional
3. **General Science** - 3 courses (PHYS102, BIOL101, CHEM102) â€¢ 0-3 hours optional
4. **Department Electives** - 3 courses (CS201, CS301, CS401) â€¢ 0-9 hours optional

**Total:** 12 elective courses across 4 categories

## User Experience Flow

### Step 1: Default View

```
Student opens preferences
â†’ Sees "All Courses (12)" active
â†’ Dropdown shows all 12 electives
â†’ Category badges show full counts (3/3 each)
```

### Step 2: Filter by Category

```
Student clicks "Islamic Studies (3/3)"
â†’ Badge becomes solid/active
â†’ "Clear filter" button appears
â†’ Dropdown shows only ISL101, ISL102, ISL103
â†’ Placeholder: "Select from Islamic Studies..."
```

### Step 3: Make Selection

```
Student selects ISL101
â†’ Badge updates to "Islamic Studies (2/3)"
â†’ ISL101 appears in ranked list with category badge
â†’ Dropdown now shows ISL102, ISL103
```

### Step 4: Switch Categories

```
Student clicks "Math/Statistics (3/3)"
â†’ Islamic Studies badge returns to outline style
â†’ Math/Statistics badge becomes solid/active
â†’ Dropdown shows MATH202, STAT201, MATH301
â†’ Selected ISL101 still visible in ranked list
```

### Step 5: Clear Filter

```
Student clicks "Clear filter" or "All Courses"
â†’ Returns to full 12-course view
â†’ "Clear filter" button disappears
â†’ All badges return to default state
â†’ Counter shows total available (11 remaining)
```

## Technical Implementation

### New State

```typescript
const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState<string>("all");
```

### Filter Algorithm

```typescript
// 1. Remove already selected courses
// 2. Apply category filter
const availableCourses = electiveCourses
  .filter((course) => !selectedCourses.find((s) => s.code === course.code))
  .filter((course) =>
    activeFilter === "all" ? true : course.category === activeFilter
  );
```

### Counter Calculation

```typescript
// Total courses in category
const count = electiveCourses.filter((c) => c.category === category).length;

// Available (not selected) in category
const availableCount = electiveCourses.filter(
  (c) =>
    c.category === category && !selectedCourses.find((s) => s.code === c.code)
).length;
```

## Benefits

### Speed

- âœ… Instant filtering (client-side, no API calls)
- âœ… Focus on 3 courses instead of scrolling through 12
- âœ… Faster decision-making

### Organization

- âœ… See courses grouped by academic requirement
- âœ… Understand which requirement each course fulfills
- âœ… Balance selections across categories

### Feedback

- âœ… Visual progress with counters
- âœ… Know when category fully selected
- âœ… Clear indication of active filter

### Usability

- âœ… Simple one-click filtering
- âœ… No complex UI or settings
- âœ… Intuitive badge interaction pattern

## Code Changes Summary

### Added Imports

```typescript
import { X, Filter } from "lucide-react"; // Added Filter icon
```

### Added State

```typescript
const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState<string>("all");
const categories = Array.from(new Set(electiveCourses.map((c) => c.category)));
```

### Updated Filter Logic

```typescript
// Before: Only removed selected courses
const availableCourses = electiveCourses.filter(
  (course) => !selectedCourses.find((selected) => selected.code === course.code)
);

// After: Also applies category filter
const availableCourses = electiveCourses
  .filter((course) => !selectedCourses.find((s) => s.code === course.code))
  .filter((course) =>
    activeFilter === "all" ? true : course.category === activeFilter
  );
```

### Added UI Section

```tsx
{
  /* Category Filters */
}
<div className="space-y-2">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Filter className="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-muted-foreground" />
    <Label>Filter by category</Label>
    {activeFilter !== "all" && (
      <Button onClick={() => setActiveFilter("all")}>Clear filter</Button>
    )}
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
    {/* Filter badges with counters */}
  </div>
</div>;
```

### Updated Placeholder Logic

```tsx
// Before: Simple static text
placeholder="Select a course..."

// After: Dynamic based on filter
placeholder={
  availableCourses.length > 0
    ? activeFilter === "all"
      ? "Select a course..."
      : `Select from ${activeFilter}...`
    : activeFilter === "all"
    ? "All courses selected"
    : `All ${activeFilter} courses selected`
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Near-term (Easy wins)

1. **Credit Hours in Badges** - Show "Islamic Studies (2/3) â€¢ 4 hrs"
2. **Category Descriptions** - Tooltips explaining requirements
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Alt+1-4 for quick category switching

### Mid-term (More work)

4. **Progress Bars** - Visual representation of hour requirements
5. **Smart Recommendations** - Highlight categories needing more selections
6. **Multi-Select Filters** - Combine multiple categories at once

### Long-term (Requires backend)

7. **Saved Preferences** - Remember last used filter
8. **Analytics** - Track which categories students browse most
9. **Dynamic Requirements** - Pull min/max hours from database
10. **Validation** - Enforce category hour constraints

## Performance Impact

âœ… **Minimal overhead:**

- Small dataset (12 courses)
- Client-side filtering (no API calls)
- Simple array operations
- No additional libraries needed

## Accessibility

âœ… **Compliant:**

- Semantic HTML with proper labels
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Clear visual indicators
- High contrast badge styles
- Screen-reader friendly counters

## Conclusion

This enhancement transforms the elective selection experience from:

- **Before:** Scrolling through 12 mixed courses
- **After:** Focused browsing by academic requirement

Students can now quickly find courses by category, track their progress with smart counters, and make informed decisions about balancing requirements across different elective types.

The implementation follows the existing component patterns, integrates seamlessly with the SWE plan data structure, and requires no backend changes. It's a pure UI enhancement that significantly improves usability.
