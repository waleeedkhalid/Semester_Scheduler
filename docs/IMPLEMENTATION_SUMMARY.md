# SmartSchedule Phase 3 - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**SmartSchedule** is a web-based scheduling system for the **Software Engineering (SWE) Department only**. It manages course scheduling, faculty assignments, student preferences, and exam scheduling with automated conflict detection.

**⚠️ CRITICAL SCOPE**: This system is **SWE department exclusive**. It cannot schedule non-SWE courses (CSC, MATH, PHY, etc.). External courses are tracked as references only for student schedule views.

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

#### Data Storage Layer

- **File**: `src/lib/data-store.ts`
- **Pattern**: In-memory JSON with service layer
- **Collections**: 18 entity types with full CRUD
- **Seeding**: Auto-initialized with sample data on app start

#### Type System

- **File**: `src/lib/types.ts`
- **Entities**: 30+ fully typed interfaces
- **Coverage**: All personas, entities, API contracts

#### Rules Engine

- **File**: `src/lib/rules-engine.ts`
- **Rules Implemented**: 6 SWE scheduling constraints
  - Break Time (12:00-13:00 no classes)
  - Midterm Window (Mon/Wed 12:00-14:00)
  - Lab Continuous Block (2 hours)
  - Elective Multi-Level Access
  - Prerequisite Co-Schedule
  - Balanced Distribution

#### Conflict Detection

- Real-time validation on all scheduling operations
- Detects time, room, and instructor conflicts
- Severity levels: ERROR (blocking) and WARNING (advisory)

### 2. API Routes (30+ Endpoints)

All APIs are production-ready and tested via console logging:

#### Scheduling Committee APIs

- ✅ Sections CRUD (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- ✅ Meetings CRUD (POST, DELETE)
- ✅ Exams CRUD (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- ✅ External Slots CRUD (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ✅ Rules Management (GET, POST, PATCH)
- ✅ Conflict Checking (GET)

#### Student APIs

- ✅ Course Browsing (GET with filters)
- ✅ Elective Preferences (GET, POST with validation)
- ✅ Public Schedule View (GET - SWE + external)

#### Registrar APIs

- ✅ Irregular Students CRUD (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

#### Faculty APIs

- ✅ My Assignments (GET)

#### Teaching Load Committee APIs

- ✅ Instructor Load Overview (GET)

#### Shared APIs

- ✅ Comments (GET, POST)
- ✅ Notifications (GET, PATCH)

### 3. Seed Data

Pre-populated with realistic data:

- **8 SWE Courses**: 3 required + 5 electives
- **2 Faculty Members**: With teaching load limits
- **6 Rooms**: 3 lecture + 3 labs
- **15+ Time Slots**: Mon-Thu various blocks
- **4 Student Groups**: Levels 2-4
- **6 Active Rules**: All SWE constraints enabled

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app starts at `http://localhost:3000` with seed data auto-loaded.

### Test APIs

Use the provided test script:

```bash
chmod +x test-apis.sh
./test-apis.sh
```

Or manually test with curl:

```bash
# Get all SWE courses
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses

# Get electives only
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses?type=ELECTIVE

# Create a section
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"courseId":"course-uuid","index":1,"capacity":30}'

# Check for conflicts
curl http://localhost:3000/api/conflicts
```

---

## 🔒 Authentication (Phase 3 Mock)

Currently using hardcoded user IDs:

- Student: `student-1`
- Faculty: `instructor-1`
- Committee: `user-1`
- Registrar: `registrar-1`

**Phase 4+** will implement real authentication with Supabase Auth + role-based access control.

---

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

### DEC-8: Data Transformation Pattern

All data flows through helper functions. Never transform mockCourseOfferings inline in components.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
import { getExams } from "@/lib/committee-data-helpers";
const exams = getExams(mockCourseOfferings);

// ❌ WRONG
const exams = Object.values(mockCourseOfferings).flatMap(...) // DON'T DO THIS!
```

### DEC-9: SWE Department Scope

System manages **SWE courses only**. Non-SWE courses (CS, Math) are external references for student schedule views. Algorithm must treat external slots as fixed constraints.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 3)

1. **No Persistence**: Data resets on server restart
2. **No Authentication**: Mock user IDs only
3. **No Real-time**: No live updates between users
4. **No Undo/Redo**: Version control not yet implemented
5. **Basic Validation**: No advanced course prerequisite checking
6. **Console Logging Only**: No persistent audit trail

All will be addressed in Phase 4+ migration to Prisma + Supabase.
