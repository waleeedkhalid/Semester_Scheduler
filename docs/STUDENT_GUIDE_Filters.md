# Student Guide: Using Elective Course Filters

## Quick Start

### What Are Filters?

Filters help you organize elective courses by their academic requirement type, making it faster and easier to find and select the courses you need.

## How to Use

### 1. **See All Courses (Default)**

When you first open the elective preferences page, you'll see:

```
🔍 Filter by category

[All Courses (12)]  [Islamic Studies (3/3)]  [Math/Statistics (3/3)]
[General Science (3/3)]  [Department Electives (3/3)]
```

- **"All Courses"** is highlighted (active)
- The dropdown shows all 12 elective courses
- Each category badge shows how many courses it contains

### 2. **Filter by Category**

Click any category badge to see only courses from that requirement:

**Example: Click "Islamic Studies"**

```
🔍 Filter by category                     [Clear filter]

[All Courses (12)]  [Islamic Studies (3/3)]  [Math/Statistics (3/3)]
[General Science (3/3)]  [Department Electives (3/3)]
```

**What changes:**

- ✅ "Islamic Studies" badge is now highlighted
- ✅ "Clear filter" button appears
- ✅ Dropdown shows only ISL101, ISL102, ISL103
- ✅ Placeholder says "Select from Islamic Studies..."

### 3. **Select Courses**

Pick courses from the filtered dropdown:

- Select ISL101 → It appears in your ranked list
- Badge updates to "Islamic Studies (2/3)" → 2 courses still available
- Dropdown now shows only ISL102, ISL103

### 4. **Switch Categories**

Click a different category badge to change what you're browsing:

- Click "Math/Statistics" → See only math courses
- Click "General Science" → See only science courses
- Click "Department Electives" → See only CS courses

**Your selected courses stay in the ranked list** regardless of which filter is active!

### 5. **Clear the Filter**

Two ways to see all courses again:

1. Click the **"Clear filter"** button
2. Click the **"All Courses"** badge

Both do the same thing: return to showing all 12 electives.

## Understanding the Counters

### Badge Format: `Category (X/Y)`

- **X** = Available courses (not yet selected)
- **Y** = Total courses in category

### Examples

**"Islamic Studies (3/3)"**

- 3 courses available
- You haven't selected any Islamic Studies courses yet

**"Islamic Studies (1/3)"**

- 1 course available
- You've already selected 2 Islamic Studies courses
- The counter helps you track your progress

**"Islamic Studies (0/3)"**

- 0 courses available
- You've selected all 3 Islamic Studies courses
- Category is complete! ✓

## Categories Explained

### Islamic Studies (3 courses)

**Requirement:** 2-4 credit hours  
**Courses:** ISL101, ISL102, ISL103  
**Note:** You must select at least one Islamic Studies course

### Math/Statistics (3 courses)

**Requirement:** 0-6 credit hours (optional)  
**Courses:** MATH202, STAT201, MATH301  
**Note:** Optional, but can help with advanced CS topics

### General Science (3 courses)

**Requirement:** 0-3 credit hours (optional)  
**Courses:** PHYS102, BIOL101, CHEM102  
**Note:** Broadens your science background

### Department Electives (3 courses)

**Requirement:** 0-9 credit hours (optional)  
**Courses:** CS201, CS301, CS401  
**Note:** Advanced CS topics outside core curriculum

## Tips for Success

### 1. **Browse by Requirement**

Use filters to explore each category systematically:

- Check Islamic Studies first (required)
- Look at Math/Statistics if interested
- Review General Science options
- Explore Department Electives last

### 2. **Balance Your Selections**

The counters help you balance across categories:

- Don't select all 6 from one category
- Mix Islamic, Math, Science, and CS courses
- Consider your career goals and interests

### 3. **Watch the Counters**

Pay attention to availability numbers:

- "(3/3)" = Full category available
- "(1/3)" = Only 1 course left
- "(0/3)" = Category complete

### 4. **Use "Clear Filter" Often**

Switch between filtered and full views:

- Filter to focus on one requirement
- Clear to see your overall progress
- Filter again to explore another category

### 5. **Check Your Ranked List**

Your selections are always visible below:

- See all selected courses
- Check category distribution with badges
- Remove and reorder as needed

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I filter by multiple categories at once?

**A:** Not yet, but this is a planned future enhancement!

**Pro Tip:** Use filters to explore systematically. Don't just scroll through all 12 courses randomly. Focus on one category at a time for better decision-making!

**Remember:** This is a _preference_ ranking. You're telling the system which courses you want, in order. The actual enrollment will depend on seat availability and schedule conflicts.

Good luck with your elective selections! 🎓
