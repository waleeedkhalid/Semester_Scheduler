# Phase 4: Core Generation - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Phase 5 (API & UI)

---

## 📋 Overview

Phase 4 implements the core schedule generation algorithm that brings together all components from Phases 1-3 to generate complete, conflict-aware course schedules for the SWE Department.

---

## ✅ Deliverables

### 1. **ScheduleGenerator Class** (`src/lib/schedule/ScheduleGenerator.ts`)

**Purpose:** Main orchestrator for schedule generation

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Level-by-level generation approach
- ✅ Student assignment to sections (~30 students per section)
- ✅ Faculty assignment based on preferences and availability
- ✅ Room allocation from available pool
- ✅ Exam scheduling (midterm, final)
- ✅ Elective section generation based on student demand
- ✅ Integrated conflict detection
- ✅ Resource utilization tracking

**Architecture:**

```typescript
ScheduleGenerator
├── generate(request) → GeneratedSchedule
│   ├── Step 1: Data Collection (ScheduleDataCollector)
│   ├── Step 2: Level-by-level Generation
│   │   ├── generateLevelSchedule()
│   │   │   ├── generateCourseWithSections()
│   │   │   │   ├── generateSection()
│   │   │   │   │   ├── generateMeetingTimes()
│   │   │   │   │   ├── assignRoom()
│   │   │   │   │   └── assign Faculty
│   │   │   │   └── scheduleExams()
│   │   │   ├── getExternalCourses()
│   │   │   └── generateElectiveSections()
│   ├── Step 3: Conflict Detection (ConflictChecker)
│   └── Step 4: Metadata Calculation
```

### 2. **Generation Algorithms**

#### **Section Assignment Algorithm**

```typescript
Input: Student count, course code, level
Process:
  1. Calculate number of sections needed (studentCount / 30)
  2. For each section:
     - Assign unique section ID
     - Set capacity (30 students)
     - Generate meeting times
     - Assign faculty from preference list
     - Allocate room from available pool
Output: Array of Section objects
```

#### **Faculty Assignment Strategy**

```typescript
Priority:
  1. Faculty with course in preferences list
  2. Faculty available at assigned time slots
  3. Faculty within teaching hour limits
  4. Round-robin distribution for fairness
```

#### **Exam Scheduling Algorithm**

```typescript
Input: Course code
Process:
  1. Select exam dates (midterm: ~week 7, final: ~week 16)
  2. Assign exam time slots from available pools:
     - 08:00 (120 min)
     - 11:00 (120 min)
     - 14:00 (120 min)
     - 16:00 (120 min)
  3. Check for conflicts with other courses
Output: Exam schedule with dates and times
```

#### **Elective Generation Algorithm**

```typescript
Input: Level, student preferences, elective slots
Process:
  1. Calculate demand for each elective:
     - Count students who ranked each elective
     - Weight by preference ranking
  2. Sort electives by demand (descending)
  3. Offer top 5 demanded electives
  4. Create sections based on demand:
     - 1 section per 30 students
Output: Array of elective course offerings
```

### 3. **Meeting Time Patterns**

Four standard patterns to minimize conflicts:

| Pattern | Days                        | Time        |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1       | Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday   | 09:00-09:50 |
| 2       | Monday, Wednesday, Thursday | 10:00-10:50 |
| 3       | Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday  | 11:00-11:50 |
| 4       | Monday, Tuesday, Thursday   | 13:00-13:50 |

### 4. **Room Pool**

16 available classrooms:

- CCIS 1A: 101, 102, 103, 104
- CCIS 1B: 101, 102, 103, 104
- CCIS 2A: 101, 102, 103, 104
- CCIS 2B: 101, 102, 103, 104

## 🔍 Conflict Detection Integration

The generator integrates ConflictChecker from Phase 3 to detect:

1. **Time Conflicts** - Overlapping class times
2. **Exam Conflicts** - Multiple exams at same time
3. **Faculty Conflicts** - Instructor double-booking
4. **Room Conflicts** - Same room, overlapping times
5. **Capacity Conflicts** - Enrollment exceeds capacity
6. **Student Conflicts** - Students in overlapping classes

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**

- Detected conflicts reported in generated schedule
- Can be used to trigger regeneration with adjustments
- Provides detailed information for manual resolution

---

## 📈 Metadata Tracking

The generator calculates comprehensive metadata:

```typescript
interface ScheduleMetadata {
  totalSections: number; // Total sections created
  totalExams: number; // Total exams scheduled
  facultyUtilization: number; // % of faculty hours used (0-100)
  roomUtilization: number; // % of room slots used (0-100)
}
```

**Usage:**

- Monitor resource efficiency
- Identify over/under-utilization
- Guide capacity planning
- Support decision-making
