# Contributing Guidelines

## Branching

- Main branch = `master`
- Feature branches: `feature/<task-name>`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<short-desc>`
- Docs branches: `docs/<topic>`

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch for each task.
3. Commit small, focused changes.
4. Open a Pull Request to `master`.
5. At least **2 team members** must review before merge.

## Commit Message Format

- `feat: <new feature>`
- `fix: <bug fix>`
- `docs: <documentation>`
- `refactor: <code cleanup>`
- `test: <unit or integration tests>`
